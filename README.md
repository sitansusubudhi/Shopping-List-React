# Shopping-List-React

The aim of this project is to break down an app into components so that they are modular, composable (can be assembled in various
ways to achieve the desired result on the page), and reusable.

This exercise focuses on the concept of passing data into components, creating
Stateless Functional Components, adding state to components, updating state, and
creating Controlled Components.
